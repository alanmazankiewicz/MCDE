I store here the different functions that I tried but that were not so successful for the instantiation of MWP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was several ideas, like combining the p-values from both sides of the cut using Stouffer's or Fisher's method
But it was not very successful

Other interesting methods where using the Rank-Biserial correlation or the Z Values

There was the idea to take into account tie correction, but it did lead to larger runtime.
And also the idea to pick a random number of other dimensions, instead of all others.
or correct the slice such that the number of points in the slice does not exceed alpha (expensive)

Before I was also cutting randomly and averaging the scores from the two cuts
